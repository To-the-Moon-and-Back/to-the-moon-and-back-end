## Sun
- The central star of our solar system, the Sun is a main-sequence star, which
make up roughly 90% of all stars in the universe. It's roughly 110 times as wide
as the Earth is, and contains 99.8% of all the system's mass - which is why
everything revolves around it!

### Core
- Deep in the sun's core is the beating heart of the entire solar system. It's
hard to believe that so much is powered by a reaction on the atomic scale.
Under pressure from the gravity of the sun being so massive, hydrogen atoms fuse
into helium, providing the energy that lights up the entire solar system. It
produces 1.8 billion times the energy of the largest nuclear bomb detonated on
Earth... every single second!

### Photosphere
- When you look up into the sky (but hopefully not directly!) the bright ball of
the photosphere is the part of the sun you're looking at. Though often depicted
as being yellow, the light from the sun is white. When it hits the Earth's
atmosphere, a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering causes it to look yellow, as
well as the sky blue. The same phenomenon is responsible for the brilliant
colors of both sunrises and sunsets.

### Corona
- Just like the Earth, the sun also has an atmosphere. The largest part of it is
known as its corona. Though it is not usually visible thanks to the brightness
of the photosphere, during eclipses - when the moon's orbit puts it in the right
place to block out the majority of the sun's light - it becomes readily apparent.
Particles stream out of the corona to create solar wind, which is responsible
for such phenomena as the auroras, and comets having tails, among others.

### Sunspots
- Sun spots happen when fluctuations in the sun cause areas of the surface to be
not as hot as their surroundings, causing that area to look darker than the rest
of the sun. Despite only appearing as spots, they can grow to a size several
times our own planet's! They can last anywhere from a few days to a few months,
and tend to increase and decrease in frequency based off of eleven-year cycles.

### Solar Flares
- Solar flares are bright flashes caused by increased activity from the sun, in
conjunction with a coronal mass ejection - an intense wave of energized
particles that erupt from the sun and fly out into the solar system. While they
are relatively common, they can cause electrical problems should the Earth be in
the path of a flare, thanks to the disturbances they can cause in the atmosphere.

## Mercury
- Named for the speedy Roman messenger god, Mercury is the closest planet to the
sun as well as the smallest. Only about a sixth the width and a twentieth of the
size of Earth, it lacks an atmosphere, and temperatures can vary wildly based on
whether you're on the bright or dark side of the planet - anywhere from 800 to
-300 degrees.

### Apollodorus
- This crater, located within the Pantheon Fossae, is remarkable because of the
long troughs that radiate out from the center. When first discovered, it was
nicknamed the Spider because of the web like shape. It is still uncertain if the
impact caused them, or whether the asteroid that caused the crater merely landed
in the center of a pre-existing formation.

### Caloris Basin
- The Caloris basin is one of the largest impact craters in the Solar System,
measuring at over 900 miles wide. The asteroid that created the impact was
likely at least 60 miles wide, larger than the one theorized to have caused the
dinosaurs' extinction. The impact was so violent that it caused deformations in
the terrain on the exact opposite side of the planet (the antipode).

### Poles
- Despite being the planet closest to the sun, Mercury can get quite cold. At
the poles of the planet, hidden perpetually from the sun in the shadows of
craters, there's ample evidence that there is large amounts of ice lying frozen.
Though a fraction of what exists on Earth's polar regions, it is still enough to
be at least a couple miles deep.

### Debussy
- Named after the French composer, this crater, along with a similar one named
Hakusai, are prominent enough to be detected from Earth using radio telescopes.
It has a very noticeable ray pattern stretching out from the impact center, which
indicates that it's relatively new. It was one of the first things photographed
by the MESSENGER probe, sent to orbit the planet from 2011 to 2015.

### Tolstoj
- The Tolstoj crater is notable for its well-preserved ejecta blanket and the
reflective material that has settled into the crater plain, leaving it an easy
to spot bright patch on the planet's surface. It is one of the oldest craters on
Mercury, being estimated to be nearly 4 billion years old.

## Venus
- The second largest of the terrestrial planets, behind only Earth, which it is
very close in size to,  Venus is named after the Roman god of love, and is one
of the brightest objects in the night sky. Despite the name, however, it is a far
from lovely place, featuring a number of hostile elements that make sending even
unmanned probes a difficult endeavor.

### Atmosphere
- The thick atmosphere of Venus means despite being further away from the sun than
Mercury, it's actually the hottest planet in the system with a surface temperature
of 870 degrees Fahrenheit. It's caused by a runaway greenhouse effect - since it's
made of nearly 96% carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is also so dense that the
pressure is 90 times that of Earth. Oh, and the clouds and rain are made of
sulfuric acid.

### Terra
- While there are no oceans on Venus - water is incompatible with such harsh
conditions - areas of highland terrain that rise up above the volcanic plains
make up the rough landmasses of Venus. These are known as terra, and there are
three - the two major ones, Aphrodite Terra (around the size of South America)
and Ishtar Terra (somewhere between the continental US and Australia), as well
as a smaller one, Lada Terra, at Venus's south pole.

### Regio
- Regio are large plateaus that rise above Venus's surface. They are composed of
some of the most intriguing tectonic features of Venus, such as the highly deformed
tesserae terrain in the Alpha Regio, or the large Devana Chasma rift zone that
cuts through the Beta Regio. These were some of the first regions of the surface
to be detected by radar, as the cloud cover made telescopic observation impossible.

### Maxwell Montes
- Maxwell Montes is the highest mountain on Venus, standing at about 35,000 feet
tall. Rising from the Ishtar Terra on the northern half of the planet, the mountain
is one of just three features not named after women or ancient goddesses on the
entire surface of the planet, having been grandfathered in before the International
Astronomical Union made the decision on nomenclature for further discoveries.

### Maat Mons
- Named for the Egyptian goddess of truth, Maat Mons is the largest volcano on
Venus and the second highest on the planet. Venus is the most volcanically active
planet in the entire solar system, with over 1600 major volcanoes across the
surface. Indeed, there's evidence that the entire planet is periodically resurfaced
in floods of lava.

## Moon
- Our closest celestial companion, the moon orbits around our planet Earth roughly
every 28 days, and rotates around its axis in the same time frame, meaning that
we only ever see the familiar side of the surface. It is the fifth-largest moon
in the Solar System, behind Saturn's moon Titan and three of the four Galilean
moons of Jupiter (Ganymede, Callisto and Io).

### Sea of Tranquility
- Mare, or seas, are dark features most common on the near side of the moon - where
volcanic eruptions have covered these regions in basalt, which reflects less of
the sun's light. Generally wide and flat, the most famous of these is the Sea of
Tranquility, where on July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 became the first manned lunar landing.

### Tycho
- Perhaps the most notable crater on the near side of the moon thanks to its
distinctive rays that spread out across the southern side. It is a relatively
young crater by the standards of the moon, having impacted roughly 108 million
years ago, which means unlike other prominent craters, it has yet to be malformed
by further impacts.

### Aitken Basin
- The largest impact crater on the moon, and one of the largest in the entire solar
system is located on the South Pole, creating the South Pole-Aitken Basin. Mostly
visible from the far side of the moon, the crater is 1600 miles wide, and 4 to 5
miles deep. On the near side visible from Earth, only the outer ring of the basin,
known as the Leibnitz mountains, can be seen.

### Oceanus Procellarum
- Of all the dark spots that splotch the near side of the moon, only Procellarum,
the largest by some stretch, was given the title Oceanus - or ocean, in comparison
to the mare, or seas, that are defined elsewhere. It covers 10% of the entire lunar
surface, and has been visited by a series of probes - the Soviet Luna 9 and 13,
and the American Surveyor 1 and 3. Apollo 12 would land close to the Surveyor 3
site, returning parts of the probe home with them, the only time this was ever done.

### Mare Orientale
- Though the name means Eastern Sea, it is so called because it appears on the
east from Earth - it is actually on the west side of the moon. Though difficult
to see because it lies on the boundary of what is visible, satellite imagery in
the 1960s revealed it to have a striking set of concentric circles, making almost
a target bullseye on the moon. The inner ring of mountains is known as the Montes
Rook, while the outer ring are known as the Montes Cordillera.

## Mars
- The furthest out of the terrestrial planets, Mars stands out for both its
brilliant red hue as well as its likelihood as the next target of human space
travel. Named for the Roman god of war, it is the second smallest of all the
planets, larger than only Mercury. It's roughly half the width of Earth and about
a sixth of the size. Temperatures in the thin atmosphere can range from -225 to
100 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Olympus Mons
- The largest mountain on any planet in the solar system, the volcano Olympus Mons
towers over the Martian surface, rising 85,000 feet from the surrounding terrain.
It is, in fact, so tall that it almost rises above the Martian atmosphere, close
to sticking out all the way into space. At two and a half times the size of Mount
Everest, were it to be placed in the deepest part of the Pacific Ocean, it would
still rise higher than most commercial jetliners fly.

### Valles Marineris
- The Valles Marineris is a noticeable scar on the Martian surface, a canyon that
would dwarf the Earth's Grand Canyon, at four times the depth, a dozen times the
length and over ten times the Grand Canyon's maximum width. The most likely reason
for its formation is a tectonic crack in the planet's surface, widened over time
via erosion and collapses of the rift walls.

### Borealis Basin
- Most of the north of Mars lies in a very wide basin that covers 40% of the entire
planet. The basin is considerably smoother than the rest of the planet's surface
and is mostly flat, though the volcanic Tharsis Bulge rises above it in the planet's
western hemisphere. Speculation abounds as to why the north and south of the planet
are so different - whether it be a large asteroid impact (if so, the basin would
be the largest crater in the Solar System by a fourfold margin) or perhaps a vast
ocean in Mars' distant past.

### Hellas Planitia
- This crater impact site is not quite the largest on Mars, but is noticeable for
being incredibly deep - over thirty thousand feet lower than the surrounding terrain.
The crater is so deep that it causes changes to the Martian atmosphere, and the
air pressure at the bottom of the crater is double what it is elsewhere on the
Martian surface. In fact, it's one of the few places on Mars that has sufficient
pressure to sustain liquid water, were the temperature to stay warm enough.

### Phobos and Deimos
- The two moons of Mars are tiny - Phobos is less than 15 miles long, with Deimos
being less than 10. They are still visible from the Martian surface, however,
thanks to orbiting much closer to the planet. They are named after twin sons of the
Greek god Ares, who is the analogue to the Roman god Mars. Though it is not known
for certain, the most likely scenario is that Mars captured these moons from the
asteroid belt.

## Jupiter
- Jupiter, named after the king of the Roman gods, is by a considerable margin
the largest of all the planets, and the closest of the gas giants in the entire
solar system. It has 70% of all the planetary mass in the solar system - even
though that still only contributes to about one thousandth of the sun's mass -
and is roughly 11 times as wide as the Earth and a thousand times as large. It has
no surface, but the temperature in the atmosphere is roughly -150 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Great Red Spot
- The clouds of Jupiter swirl constantly through its atmosphere, easily reaching
speeds of 225 miles per hour. Most prominent among the clouds however, is the
Great Red Spot, a large and persistent storm south of the planet's equator. It has
been observed in the Jovian atmosphere since at least the 17th century, and is
larger than the size of the Earth. That said, the storm has been observed getting
smaller in recent years.

### Ganymede
- Ganymede is the largest moon in the entire Solar System, and is, indeed, even
larger than the planet Mercury. The four largest moons of Jupiter are known as
the Galilean moons, because they were discovered by Gailileo Galilei, and were
the first celestial objects that were seen to be rotating around another planet.
Ganymede is the only moon to have a magnetic field, though its magnetosphere is
subsumed within Jupiter's much larger one.

### Callisto
- Callisto is the most distant of the four Galilean moons, and the second largest.
Like the others, it is named after a mythological lover of Zeus, Jupiter's Greek
equivalent. These four moons consist of 99.997% of all the mass in the Jovian
system. Callisto is notable for having perhaps the oldest and most pockmarked
surface in the entire Solar System - lacking volcanism or plate tectonics, the
features of its surface are entirely created by craters.

### Io
- Io is the closest of the four Galilean moons to Jupiter, though it is not the
closest to the planet - there are four much smaller ones that orbit even closer,
known as the Amalthean group. The proximity to Jupiter, however, has made the moon
intensely volcanic - it is, in fact, the most volcanically active object within
the solar system, even moreso than Venus.  

### Europa
- Made famous by Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Europa is notable for
evidence that underneath its icy exterior there may lay a fully liquid water
ocean, heated by the tides caused from the orbital resonance between it, Jupiter,
Io and Ganymede. This makes it one of the most sought after places to further
analyze in the search for biological life forms outside of Earth.

## Saturn
- Named after the Roman god of wealth, agriculture and time, who also served as
the father of Jupiter, Saturn is the other gas giant of the Solar System. It's a
very light planet, as despite being nine times as wide and about 750 times as big
as the Earth, it's only 100 times as heavy - meaning that it could actually float,
were there a body of water long enough. Like the other giant planets, it has no
true surface, but the temperature in the atmosphere is about -200 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Rings
- Easily the most defining attribute of Saturn is its extensive ring system. While
all of the giant planets of the system have some sort of ring structure, Saturn's
is by far the most prominent. Going from roughly 4000 miles above the equator to
fifty thousand miles out, the rings are remarkably thin - less than a mile thick
- and made almost completely out of ice.

### Polar Storms
- Both the north and south pole of Saturn are the center of some long lasting
storms with some curious features. A large hexagon shaped storm, eighteen thousand
miles wide spins around the North Pole of Saturn at roughly 200 miles per hour.
At the South Pole, a hurricane like vortex - with an eyewall formation never seen
outside our planet - is roughly the same size of Earth and has winds up to 340
miles per hour.

### Titan
- The largest moon around Saturn and the second largest moon in the entire Solar
System behind only Ganymede, Titan is unique among all satellites in that it has
a full atmosphere covering it. Indeed, until the Cassini-Huygens probe began
investigating it in the early 2000s, much underneath the atmosphere remained a
mystery. However, underneath the clouds lies the only other known location of liquid
seas - though they're of hydrocarbons instead of water.

### Mimas
- Mimas is the closest and smallest of Saturn's major moons - though there are
over 80 of them, most of the mass is contained in 7 - and of those, 96% is in
Titan. Mimas has a large crater called Herschel, with a diameter a third of the
entire moon, and which gives it a more than passing resemblance to the Death Star
of Star Wars fame.

### Iapetus
- Third largest and furthest out of the major moons of Saturn, Iapetus has a
couple of striking features of note. First is the equatorial ridge that runs most
of the way around the moon, giving it a sort of walnut shape. The other is that
it has two distinctive sides - one a bright, reflective white, and the other a
dark reddish-brown, which causes it to be more visible from one side of Saturn
than the other.

## Uranus
- Unique in several aspects, Uranus is named after the Greek, not Roman, god of
the sky, father to Cronus (Saturn's equivalent) and grandfather to Zeus (Jupiter's
equivalent). It is the first planet to have been discovered, by William Herschel,
in 1781, rather than been known to the ancients. It and Neptune form the ice giants -
smaller than the two gas giants, but still considerably larger than the terrestrial
planets. Four times as wide and sixty times as large as Earth, the sheer distance
from the sun means that the average temperature runs roughly -320 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Axis
- While most planets spin around themselves vertically - or at the very least only
a slight tilt, Uranus is an oddball in the sense that it rotates more or less on
its side, having an axial tilt of 97 degrees. This means that the two poles alternate
between facing the sun - and given the length of the Uranian year, the day-night
cycles for the poles last over 40 Earth years.

### Miranda
- The smallest of Uranus' five major moons, Miranda is perhaps the most intriguing
because of its unique topography - rather than a round sphere, it is has jagged
and broken terrain. Among these features lies the largest cliff in the Solar System
- a scarp called Verona Rupes, 12 miles from top to bottom. Its low gravity, however,
means that it'd take roughly 12 minutes for you to actually fall off of it, and
might still be survivable with enough impact cushioning.

### Umbriel
- Named for a shadowy fairy from the literature of Alexander Pope, Umbriel is the
third largest of Uranus' moons, but also the darkest. There is, however, a crater
on the moon, named Wunda, that has left behind a ring of bright material that stands
out on the duskier surface. It lies on the moon's equator - though because all of
Uranus' moons share the planet's odd axial tilt, it appears in the Voyager 2 images
as if it were on the moon's north pole from a casual observation.

### Oberon and Titania
- The largest of Uranus' moons, Oberon and Titania were discovered shortly after
the planet itself in 1787, by the same William Herschel who had found the planet
in the first place. As the first planet not known to antiquity, naming the planet
was something of an unexplored avenue. It was originally named after the British
King George, before Uranus was proposed a year later. The nod to its British
discoverer would be retained in its moons - they're all characters from English
literature, Oberon and Titania being the king and queen of fairies from Shakespeare's
Midsummer Night's Dream.

## Neptune
- The outermost of the planets since Pluto's demotion after the discovery of the
Kuiper Belt, Neptune is named after the Roman god of the sea - an apropos name,
given the deep, vibrant blue of the planet. It is the only planet that wasn't
found by direct observation - astronomers noted slight disturbances in the orbit
of Uranus that implied another planet was out there and was then found within a
degree of where calculations expected it. It's only slightly smaller than Uranus
- a fraction under 4 Earth widths and 60 Earth sizes and shares a similar temperature.

### Great Dark Spot
- The Great Dark Spot was first discovered in 1989, when Voyager 2 was approaching
the planet for a fly-by. Though similar to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, the storm
was smaller - though still roughly Earth sized - and much fiercer, with the highest
winds in the Solar System - 1300 miles per hour. In 1994, when observed by Hubble,
however, the storm had disappeared. Since then, it's become known that these storms
are transient - lasting years, but not permanently. They are however, frequent -
an observation in 2016 showed a new one had formed, and has remained in latest
observations.

### Triton
- Triton is the by far the largest of Neptune's moons, accounting for a full 99.7%
of all of the mass of all of the moons around the planet, and the seventh largest
in the entire Solar System behind the Galileans, Titan and our own. It is also
unique in that it was originally an object in the outer Solar System, like Pluto,
before being captured by Neptune to become a moon. This event may have destroyed
some of the moons already around Neptune, giving the planet its faint rings.

### Other Moons of Neptune
- Because of Neptune's distance, and their relatively small size, there has been
extremely limited direct observation on the rest of the moons of Neptune. The only
probe to pass through the system was Voyager 2 back in 1989 and did not approach
any of the small moons close enough for many detailed images. There's still a lot
we can detect from afar, however. Proteus, the second largest, for example, was
likely amalgamated from debris caused by Triton's capture. Nereid, the third largest,
was thrown into a highly eccentric orbit. They both may have also fragmented at
some point, creating the moons Hippocamp and Halimede, respectively.

### Trans-Neptunian Objects
- As the furthest major planet from the sun, Neptune has a large influence on the
orbits of the objects within the Kuiper Belt. Astronomers have begun categorizing
them by the type of orbital resonance they have with Neptune. The most famous of
these is Pluto, the largest Trans-Neptunian Object (TNO) found so far, and the
defining example of what have come to be known as Plutinos, which have a 2:3
resonance with Neptune (that is, they revolve twice for every 3 times Neptune does),
but there are countless different types - some of the more common are 3:5, 4:7
and 1:2 (the last of which have been nicknamed twotinos)
