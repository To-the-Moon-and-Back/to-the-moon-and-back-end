# To the Moon and Backend 

This is the final project at Turing School of Software and Design in Denver, CO. It is the backend portion of a service-oriented architecture. Working directly with a front end team, we were provided a detailed wireframe and a list of expected responses. We built an API that consumes multiple external APIs to gather and format that data required. 
Stack: Python3, Flask, Postgres, Heroku 

# Endpoints 

```GET ‘https://moon-back-end.herokuapp.com/api/v1/news’```

Example response for this request: ```GET ‘https://moon-back-end.herokuapp.com/api/v1/news’```
